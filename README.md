# Movie Sales Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to predict movie sales based on various features such as genre, budget, cast, and more. The goal is to assist film industry analysts in estimating a movie's potential revenue before its release.

## Features
- Utilizes real-world movie data for model training
- Implements machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Performs data analysis using Python libraries
- Evaluates model performance with standard metrics like RMSE and R²

- ## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

 ## Sample Output
- Scatter plot of predictions vs. actual values
- Model evaluation metrics (RMSE, R²)
- Feature importance analysis
